Concepts that resonate more as ritual slogans, meme glyphs, or embodied heuristics than structured essays. This is cognition as a wardrobe, not a cathedral.

When an idea works better as a t-shirt slogan than a lengthy essay, it's often because it's:

1. **Immediately resonant** - It clicks with existing mental models
2. **Compressible** - Can be reduced to a memorable phrase
3. **Actionable** - Provides clear direction without extensive explanation
4. **Shareable** - Easy to pass along to others

The t-shirt rule helps us identify which ideas are ready for "memetic compression" - they can be reduced to their essence without losing their power.

> "It's a wardrobe of cognition: concepts that wear well, spread fast, and compress wisdom into invocation."

Just-in-time slogans, memetic heuristics, or sigil-wisdom that floats from chat, tweet, or wastebook into embodied action rituals.
