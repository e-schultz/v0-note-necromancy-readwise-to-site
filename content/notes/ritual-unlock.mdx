'I'm doing it. I did it.' â€” executive function micro-rituals activate momentum and break the spell of inertia.

For many neurodivergent individuals, the gap between intention and action can feel insurmountable. Traditional productivity advice often fails to address the unique executive function challenges that come with ADHD, autism, and other neurodivergent conditions.

## Micro-Rituals as Executive Function Bridges

Externalization rituals serve as bridges across the intention-action gap by:

1. **Making the invisible visible** - Externalizing the process makes each step concrete
2. **Creating momentum through declaration** - Stating "I'm doing it" shifts from planning to action mode
3. **Reducing cognitive load** - External systems hold the structure so the brain doesn't have to
4. **Providing completion anchors** - "I did it" creates a clear endpoint and dopamine reward

## Practical Externalization Rituals

- **Verbal declaration** - Simply saying "I'm doing it" out loud
- **Physical anchors** - Moving a token or flipping a card to signal state change
- **Digital breadcrumbs** - Quick notes or tweets that mark progress
- **Body-based signals** - Standing up, changing locations, or other physical state changes

These rituals don't have to be elaborate. In fact, the simpler they are, the more likely they'll be used when executive function is already strained.

The power is in the consistent practice and the externalization of what would otherwise remain trapped in the planning phase.
