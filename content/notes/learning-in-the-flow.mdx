Learning is a recursively-invoked ritual: embedded, ongoing, context-sensitiveâ€”not afterthought!

Traditional approaches to learning treat it as a discrete event: attend a workshop, read a book, complete a course. But this event-based model fails to capture how effective learning actually happens, especially in fast-changing domains.

## Learning as Recursive Ritual

When we reframe learning as a recursively-invoked ritual, we recognize that:

1. **Learning happens in the flow of work** - Not separate from it
2. **Context matters more than content** - The same information lands differently depending on when and why you encounter it
3. **Repetition with variation builds understanding** - Seeing the same concept in different contexts
4. **Just-in-time beats just-in-case** - Learning when you need it sticks better than learning "someday"

## Practical Implementation

- **Embed learning triggers in workflows** - Create rituals that prompt learning at decision points
- **Capture and curate in context** - Note what you learn while doing the work
- **Share incomplete understanding** - Learning in public creates feedback loops
- **Review and reflect rhythmically** - Regular rituals to consolidate learning

By treating learning as a ritual that's invoked repeatedly throughout our work rather than a separate event, we create systems that support continuous growth and adaptation.
