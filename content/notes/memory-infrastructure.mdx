"Memory infrastructure isn't about knowing exactly where it is, but trusting you've written it before and will find it again when needed."

Traditional knowledge management systems often treat memory as a map - a precise location where information is stored. But human memory doesn't work that way, and perhaps our digital systems shouldn't either.

## The Ritual of Memory

Memory as ritual acknowledges that:

1. **The act of capturing matters more than the organization**
2. **Trust in the system is more important than its perfection**
3. **Rediscovery is part of the learning process**
4. **Fuzzy search and association mimic how our brains work**

When we treat memory as a ritual rather than a map, we focus on the practices that help us externalize our thoughts, trusting that the right connections will emerge when needed.

## Practical Implementation

- **Wastebook First**: Capture without concern for organization
- **Periodic Curation**: Light touch organization as a separate ritual
- **Search Over Structure**: Rely on search and serendipity more than rigid hierarchies
- **Embrace Forgetting**: Allow some notes to fade away naturally

The goal isn't perfect recall but rather a system that supports thinking, creating, and learning through ritualized practices of externalization and rediscovery.
