The Externalization Unlock is a micro-ritual designed to break through executive function barriers - that frustrating gap between knowing what you need to do and actually starting to do it.

This ritual is particularly valuable for neurodivergent individuals with ADHD, autism, or other conditions that can make task initiation challenging, but it's useful for anyone who struggles with procrastination or task switching.

## Why It Works

- **Verbal declaration**: Speaking "I'm doing it" activates different neural pathways than just thinking it
- **Minimal friction**: The entire ritual takes seconds, requiring almost no executive function to execute
- **External capture**: The micro-note or tweet creates accountability and a trace of intention
- **State change**: The ritual marks a clear transition from planning to action

## Variations

- **Physical token**: Move an object from one side of your desk to another
- **Digital ritual**: Change your status in a messaging app or task manager
- **Body-based**: Stand up, stretch, or change locations as part of the declaration
- **Timer-based**: Set a 2-minute timer that signals the transition period

The power of this ritual is in its simplicity and repeatability. It can be invoked multiple times throughout the day whenever you notice yourself stuck in the planning phase.
