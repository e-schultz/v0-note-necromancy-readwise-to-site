The Wastebook Curation Sweep is a lightweight ritual designed to balance the freedom of unstructured capture with the value of intentional curation.

Rather than trying to organize everything as you go (which creates friction to capture), or never organizing at all (which limits discovery), this ritual creates a middle path: regular, time-bounded curation that keeps your digital wastebook useful without becoming a burden.

## Why It Works

- **Low pressure**: You're only looking for 2-3 items to elevate
- **Resonance-driven**: Trust your intuition about what matters
- **Composting is expected**: Not everything needs to be kept
- **Ritual timing**: The weekly cadence creates a sustainable habit

## Variations

- **Daily micro-sweep**: A 5-minute version at the end of each day
- **Monthly deep dive**: A longer session focused on connecting ideas
- **Collaborative sweep**: Share and curate with a trusted group

The key is consistency and lightness - this should feel like a helpful ritual, not another task on your to-do list.
