This highlight captures the essence of how FLOAT developed - not as a planned system but as an emergent one that grew from the intersection of neurodivergent thinking patterns and early digital exploration.

The recursive nature refers to how FLOAT practices feed back into themselves, creating self-improving loops. The symbolic aspect acknowledges the importance of compressed meaning and ritual symbols that carry more information than their surface appearance. And the modularity reflects how FLOAT components can be mixed, matched, and adapted to individual needs.

This evolutionary approach stands in contrast to more prescriptive productivity systems that assume a neurotypical baseline and rigid implementation.
