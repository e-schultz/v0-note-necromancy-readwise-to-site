This highlight reframes procrastination not as a failure of productivity but as a ritual in itself - one that can be structured and leveraged rather than fought against.

The concept comes from Lichtenbergianism, a creative framework that embraces "structured procrastination" as a way to make progress on important work by avoiding other important work. By acknowledging this as a ritual, we remove the shame and instead create intentional space for this natural tendency.

This connects to FLOAT principles by recognizing that productivity isn't always linear or direct - sometimes the most effective path forward involves working with our natural tendencies rather than fighting against them.
