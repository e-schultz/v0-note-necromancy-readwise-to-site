This highlight captures the playful subversion at the heart of FLOAT - taking established knowledge management systems like Zettelkasten and introducing a "gremlin" element that makes them more suited to neurodivergent thinking patterns.

The distinction between ritual and routine is crucial. Routines are fixed, predictable sequences that can feel constraining. Rituals, on the other hand, carry meaning and intention while allowing for variation and adaptation. For recursive thinkers who tend to circle back, branch out, and make unexpected connections, ritual provides structure without confinement.

The "gremlin in the slip box" suggests embracing a bit of chaos and unpredictability in our systems rather than striving for perfect order - allowing for serendipity, surprise, and emergence.
